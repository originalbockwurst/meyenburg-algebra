ISO 754 deals with floating point calculations and in especially how the cpu calculates therefore. Divison by zero error and Floating
Point Anomalies has always been a thread. By substituting 0 by imaginary unit i we solve this problem.
Hint: Be careful to implement or can you guarantee that you always watched for 0\*0 which then is i\*i = -1 :)
